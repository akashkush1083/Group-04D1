# 📚 Multimodal Education Creator (AI Educational Content Generator)

An AI-powered educational assistant that understands user queries and automatically generates structured, topic-focused explanations using Semantic Search + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Students deal with huge amounts of study material such as PDFs, notes, articles, and textbooks.

Traditional keyword search systems:
- Do not understand meaning
- Return irrelevant results
- Require manual filtering
- Cannot generate structured explanations

This project builds an AI system that understands context instead of keywords and produces ready-to-learn explanations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand semantic meaning of user queries
- Retrieve relevant educational content using vector similarity
- Combine retrieved knowledge with AI generation (RAG)
- Automatically generate structured notes
- Provide a clean user interface
- Build a scalable modular architecture

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- Semantic Search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector Database Retrieval (FAISS)
- Automated Notes Generation
- Modular Architecture
- REST API Based System
- Efficient Document Chunking

## 🏛 System Architecture
1. Frontend UI – User enters topic
2. Backend API – Processes request
3. Embedding Module – Converts text to vectors
4. Vector Database – Stores embeddings
5. Retrieval Module – Finds relevant chunks
6. LLM Generator – Generates explanation
7. Dataset Storage – Educational material repository
